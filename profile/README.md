### Who are we?
We're a team of passionate developers creating Virtual Reality software and powerful immersive experiences!

## Our Directive: Pushing the boundaries of VR.
We are dedicated to consistently pushing the boundaries of what is possible in VR. Our development team works tirelessly to iterate and improve our platform based on community feedback. Together, we aim to blur the lines between reality and virtual reality, fostering a universe where anybody can build anything.

## Nexus: A universe where anybody can create anything.

### What is Nexus?
Nexus is our flagship project, a groundbreaking metaverse platform where individuals, businesses, and educational institutions alike can create, share, and immerse themselves in a powerful, community-generated universe. With our versatile in-verse toolkit, users can build custom worlds and avatars, ranging from creating models or importing them from external 3D applications to writing custom code in-verse through our powerful Solaris visual scripting system. For those who prefer text-based scripting, Nexus supports S#, the C#-based alternative to Solaris scripting. When paired with the Irix rendering engine, users can create virtually anything they could possibly imagine.

*Explore the possibilities, push the boundaries, and create something great with Nexus!*
